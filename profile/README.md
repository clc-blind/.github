## About Us

We are a dedicated group of students from Ho Chi Minh City University of Science
(HCMUS), united by a shared passion for technology and social impact. Our
organization, clc-blind, is committed to supporting individuals who are blind or
have low vision. Through our collaborative efforts, we design and develop
innovative programs and web solutions that empower the visually impaired
community, striving to make daily life more accessible and inclusive.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to harness the power of technology to break down barriers faced
by blind and low-vision individuals. We aim to create practical, user-friendly
tools and resources that foster independence, enhance learning opportunities,
and improve quality of life. By working closely with the community, we ensure
our solutions are meaningful, impactful, and tailored to real needs.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where technology bridges the gap between ability and
accessibility. Our goal is to be at the forefront of inclusive innovation,
inspiring others to join us in building a society where everyone, regardless of
visual ability, can thrive and participate fully. Together, we strive for a
future where equal access and opportunity are realities for all.
